# First Lab
At the theoretical part we read the article “The Laplacian Pyramid as a Compact Image Code” by Burt, P. J. And Adelson, E. H. and described how the Laplacian Pyramid is used to compress an image. At the second part we used python to create functions that take a picture and compress it into a pyramid. We also created functions that decompress the previously created pyramid

# Second Lab
At the theoretical part we read the articles “An iterative image registration technique with an application to stereo vision” and “Pyramidal Implementation of the Affine Lucas Kanade Feature Tracker Description of the algorithm” and described the use of the Lucas Kanade Feature Tracker. At the second part we used a video from the VIRAT dataset to detect motion. At first we detected corners using Harris and Shi-Tomashi algorithms. Then we detected optical flow using Lucas-Kanade algorithm
